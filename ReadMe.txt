You can run the Email_filter.py file by opening a python3 shell. This should work by double clicking it in the folder.
 
If not let me know we'll have to change your default system settings.

To run the program it will ask for a input file, output file, a csv file containing keywords to elimnate in the name field , anda csv file containing keywords to elimnate in the email field
The list you gave me for these fields in in the provided folder already.

The input file you can make in google sheets by going to File -> Downlaod -> Tab-seperated Values (I had to use this because of all the commas in the data.

The output file should be a txt file. It will be delimited with a | again due to the commas in the data. You can import this into Excel or Google sheets, just set your delimiter to |.

Please let me know if you have any questions. I'll be happy to help!
